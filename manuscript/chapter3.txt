# Chapter 3

___Working with multiple branch___

concept is -
if you want to make some change create a branch , apply your changes and when done merge it with remote branch to which you want to contribute and then push to that branch

step 1: switch to a branch
switching to a specific branch workig directory
{git checkout <branch_name>}

switch to master branch
{git branch master}

step 2:Create local branch
now i want to create a my personal local branch and want to do some work (adding myPersonalFile.txt)

when you have checked out remote repository branch (master) and when you say 
{git branch mypersonal_branch}
it will create branch from your currently checkoud branch(master)

step 3:Do my work on local branch
let's add myPersonalFile.txt in this branch and commit changes.

to compare two branch to show difference use
{git diff <branch to compare>}
{git diff origin/master}

it will list out all differences (one file added myPersonalFile.txt)

step 3: merging my changes with remote branch
now after working on a personal branch i think i am done with my work and i want to merge my changes in master branch and commit it
switch to master branch
{git branch master}
merge changes from your personal branch to master
{git merge mypersonal_branch}
merging done changes from remote branch and your local changes merged in remote checked out branch

step 4: push my work
git push
 
step 5: clean up
now we can delete mypersonal_branch
git branch -D mypersonal_branch
you cannot delete the branch which you are currently on.



___Deleting remote branch___

To delete a remote branch let say master_copy use
{git push origin :master-copy}
